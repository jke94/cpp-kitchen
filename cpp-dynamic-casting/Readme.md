# cpp-dynamic-casting

Example about how to use C++ dynamic casting to create objects that they comply with an interface, but we can manage internally as different objects using dynamic casting by a bussiness ruleset. 

On this case, the bussines ruleset is random to simulate the bussines rules. The example shows a interface public for the client and internal code.

## How to compile (on linux using g++).

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```
